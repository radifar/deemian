# Introduction to Deemian DSL

> A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a computer script that solves software problems in a specific domain. Unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) such as JavaScript or Python, DSLs have a narrower scope and purpose. This specificity allows them to provide concise code and syntax that aligns with a particular domain's programming structure and requirements.
>
> DSLs allow web developers to build intuitive solutions tailored to a limited set of problems. Popular examples include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and SQL (Structured Query Language).

Deemian is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Deep Molecular Interaction Analysis. It is both a tool and a programming language for molecular interaction analysis. The language is simple and intuitive as it uses the vocabulary of the cheminformatics and bioinformatics domain. And despite its simplicity, it is also powerful as it gives the freedom to set up the analysis in a systematic way. More importantly, since the script is easy to read and modify, it allows better readability, reproducibility, and reusability in molecular interaction studies.

   Both Deemian and Deemian Viewer is still under heavy construction. Use them at your own risk.
