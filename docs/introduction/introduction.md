# Introduction

> A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a computer script that solves software problems in a specific domain.
> Unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) such as JavaScript or Python, DSLs have a narrower scope and purpose.
> This specificity allows them to provide concise code and syntax that aligns with a particular domain's programming structure and requirements.
>
> DSLs allow web developers to build intuitive solutions tailored to a limited set of problems.
> Popular examples include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and SQL (Structured Query Language).

Deemian is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that serves as a tool and programming language for molecular interaction analysis.
The language uses the vocabulary of cheminformatics and bioinformatics domains, making it simple and intuitive.
Despite its simplicity, it is a powerful tool that allows for systematic analysis.
The script is easy to read and modify, which enhances readability, reproducibility, and reusability in molecular interaction studies.
